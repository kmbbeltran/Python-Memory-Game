The game I have created is a memory game where four squares will randomly 
display on the screen and you the user will have to match the squares given in the 
extra order. It starts out with 3 lives and decreases if you get click on one incorrect
square shown. A start screen is displayed to signal when the game will commence
with a click on the space bar. Each time you get the correct pattern your score 
will increase by 100. At the end of your three lives the game will end. There is 
a soundtrack loaded and working however the game has a feature where you hear a beep
whenever the boxes are shown and the soundtrack, no matter what volume, blocks the sound
effect so I have commented out where the soundtrack plays. The difficulty of the game does 
not increase as the game goes on however I have also submitted a file named game_test.py which 
has my attempt at raising the game difficulty. The problem is commented out and explained in the game_test.py file.
